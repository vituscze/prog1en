# How to Pass

To pass the Introduction to Algorithms practicals, you need to have sufficient homework score. To pass the Programming 1 practicals, you need to have sufficient homework score, pass the test at the end of the semester, and submit and present your semestral work.

## Homework

Homework is submitted via ReCodEx (see above). To pass the practicals, your homework score needs to be at least 70% of the maximum (excluding bonus assignments).

## Test

There will be a programming test at the very end of the semester. If you do not pass the test, there will be additional opportunities to retake it during the exam period. You have a total of three attempts.

## Semestral Project

For your semestral project, you will choose and solve a nontrivial programming task. Students typically implement some interesting algorithm, write a simple computer game or a command line tool. Before you start working on your project, I'll first need to approve the topic to make sure it's not too easy (or too hard). Send me a short description and specification of your project and wait for me to approve it before you start writing code.

Deadlines for proposals and submissions can be found [here](https://ksvi.mff.cuni.cz/~dingle/2023-4/prog_1/programming_1.html). To submit your project, you need to provide the following:

* **Implementation** - source code
* **Test data** - sample inputs and outputs, if applicable
* **User documentation** - how to use your program
* **Developer documentation** - how your program works

Once you have all that, simply send me an email (you can use my university email address or my personal one - vituscze *at* gmail *dot* com) and if everything is alright, we will meet up (online or in person) and you'll present your project to me. Note that there's usually about a week between submission and presentation, so plan accordingly.
