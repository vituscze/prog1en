# How to Pass

To pass the Introduction to Algorithms practicals, you need to have sufficient homework score. To pass the Programming 1 practicals, you need to have sufficient homework score, pass the test at the end of the semester, and submit and present your semestral work.

## Homework

Homework is submitted via ReCodEx (see above). To pass the practicals, your homework score needs to be at least 60% of the maximum (excluding bonus assignments).

## Test

There will be a programming test at the very end of the semester. If you do not pass the test, there will be additional opportunities to retake it during the exam period. You have a total of three attempts.

## Semestral Project

For your semestral project, you will choose and solve a nontrivial programming task. Students typically implement some interesting algorithm, write a simple computer game or a command line tool. Before you start working on your project, I'll first need to approve the topic to make sure it's not too easy (or too hard). Send me a short description and specification of your project and wait for me to approve it before you start writing code.

I recommend picking a topic before the end of the year (calendar, not academic year). Similarly, the project itself should be submitted and presented before the end of the exam period. However, the absolute deadline to submit your project is the end of August (i.e. next year). I won't accept any submissions after this date. To submit your project, you need to provide the following:

* **Implementation** - source code
* **Test data** - sample inputs and outputs, if applicable
* **User documentation** - how to use your program
* **Developer documentation** - how your program works

Once you have all that, simply send me an email (you can use my university email address or my personal one - vituscze *at* gmail *dot* com) and if everything is alright, we will meet up (online or in person) and you'll present your project to me. Note that there's usually about a week between submission and presentation, so plan accordingly.
